Description: Provides a lightweight HTTP(S) file server implemented in Go and exposed to R. It supports range
 requests, configurable CORS and COOP headers, and optional TLS. The package builds and runs a background server
 that can be cleanly shut down from R using an OS pipe and C/Go interop. Asynchronous log handling is also supported.
